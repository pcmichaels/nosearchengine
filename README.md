# No Search Engine

NoSearchEngine is a search engine that works off recommendations, rather that trawling the web.  

Registered users are able to store a list of resources from the web, along with descriptions, tags, and ratings.  Users can also rate sites on their usefulness, and give credit to the user that added the site.

Each added site must be approved by a user with more than a certain credit score.

Registered and unregistered users can search these resources against the descriptions.

## How to Contribute

## Running the Code

Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">npm</a>.

Entity Framework is using SQL Server, so you'll need SQL Express at least.

The code is a Visual Studio solution.
